# SimpleBlockchain

This project intends to be a lightweight cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin protocol for educational purposes. Feel free to make contributions to the project, or follow along.

# How is this different from Bitcoin and other altcoins?

The biggest difference is our goal being about learning. We don't plan to make any innovations to the blockchain technology. We just want to build the core features of blockchain for it to funciton successfully, while also making it easy to use for development. We want the code to be easy to follow along and documented well. Speed is our last concern. We are not interested in compressing data, or making mining as fast as possible.

# How can I contribute to the project?

All levels of experience are allowed to make contributions. I currently use IntelliJ Community edition when working on this project. Which you can download here. https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows Then use the IDE to import this GitHub repo. After you make a contribution to the code base then submit a pull request.
