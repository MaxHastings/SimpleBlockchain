# SimpleBlockchain

This project intends to be a lightweight cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin protocol for educational purposes. Feel free to make contributions to the project, or follow along.

# How is this different from Bitcoin and other altcoins?

The biggest difference is our goal being about learning. We don't plan to make any innovations to the blockchain technology. We just want to build the core features of blockchain for it to funciton successfully, while also making it easy to use for development. We want the code to be easy to follow along and documented well. Speed is our last concern. We are not interested in compressing data, or making mining as fast as possible.
